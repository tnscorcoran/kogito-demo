# Kogito Demo

## Introduction - Kogito and Quarkus. 

This repo covers a demo on Kogito - the new Red Hat sponsored open-source framework for business automation including
- Rules and Decisions 
- Processes and Cases

The origin of the word Kogito is - from the phrase by Rene Descartes
_Cogito, ergo sum_ meaning, _I think - therefore I am_

The 'c' was replaced with a 'k' as a reference to Kubernetes, the target cloud platform - where this framework is most applicable

though this demo is on my laptop - just to show the 3 big benefits of Kogito:
- fast startup
- low memory usage
- live code updates
